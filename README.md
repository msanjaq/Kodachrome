# Kodachrome
A game I am (periodically) making for fun and as a learning expereicne. The game has only one test level, so have a blast.

There is no special reason the name is called "Kodachrome". Just thought it was cool sounding :-)


## Compatibility

Tested and working on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.

Not working on OS X due to some issue with pygame's sound library.

## How to start the game
  
  Clone this repo and run script.py
  
  Currently the game has only one level used for testing purposes. A guide on how to create levels will be created on a later date.

# Future Plans

Currently not actively working on the game. I eventually plan to rewrite this game in C with OpenGL and use the current python implemtnation for rapid prototyping.
